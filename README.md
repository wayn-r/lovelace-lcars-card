#TODOs:
 - implement stretch to cardinal point (top, bottom, left, right, or combination)
 - implement headerbar as a standalone element
 - implement buttons
 - determine an appropriate way to handle vertical groups of elements
 - determine an appropriate way to handle groups of elements that curve into other groups of elements. visually, these look like they might be the same concept to group into a larger section
 - determine a way to implement animation logic for elements
