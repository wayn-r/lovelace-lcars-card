TODO: 
- editor elements should default to collapsed, currently they default to expanded
- 'Anchor to Element' and 'Stretch to Element' no longer have the labels inside the dropdown; put these back inside the dropdown like the others
- dropdowns correctly default to nothing, but 'Nothing' or 'None' is not an option so once an option has been selected, they're stuck that way. Add a 'None' option that doesn't display 'None' when selected.
- if possible, center align the anchor grids in a 1x2 grid
- when 'Anchor to Element' has an element selected, 'Container Anchors' should be hidden
