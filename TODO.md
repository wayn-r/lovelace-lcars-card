## BUGS
- top header is implemented, but there is a bug where anchoring to it doesn't properly position the element.

## TODOs:

### Tests
- Implement a way to automate testing to ensure updates don't break existing functionality.

### Components
- implement headerbar as a standalone element

### Layout
- determine an appropriate way to handle groups of elements that curve into other groups of elements. visually, these look like they might be the same concept to group into a larger section

### Features
- determine a way to implement animation logic for elements
