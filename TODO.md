## BUGS
## TODOs:

### Tests
- Implement a way to automate testing to ensure updates don't break existing functionality.

### Components
- implement headerbar as a standalone element
- implement pill element

### Layout
- implement text features:
    - cutout and dominantBaseline not implemented
    - fontWeight doesn't seem to work with smaller values - that might be inherent to fontWeight
    - textTransform only seems to work with uppercase and lowercase; integrate css logic or add other transforms
- determine an appropriate way to handle groups of elements that curve into other groups of elements. visually, these look like they might be the same concept to group into a larger section

### Features
- determine a way to implement animation logic for elements
