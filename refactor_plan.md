### High-level assessment
Overall the `src/` codebase has a solid shape:
- Clear layering: config parsing → element graph → layout engine → render → interactive color/animation/state.
- A good composition model: primitives in `layout/elements/*` and composites in `layout/widgets/*` via `WidgetRegistry`.
- Strong config validation with Zod (`parsers/schema.ts`), deterministic layout (`layout/engine.ts`), and a capable animation pipeline (`utils/animation.ts`, `utils/transform-propagator.ts`).

The main opportunities center on instance scoping (avoid global singletons), lifecycle boundaries, reuse vs recreate cycles, type cohesion, and explicit extensibility points.

### Highest-impact improvements

#### Scope per-card runtime (kill “global singletons”)
  - Problem: `stateManager` (`utils/state-manager.ts`), `StoreProvider` (`core/store.ts`), `loggerService` (`utils/logger-service.ts`), `animationManager`/`colorResolver` share process-wide state. Multiple cards on the same page (or hot reloads) can stomp each other’s context, subscriptions, and animation/visibility states.
  - Fix: Create a per-card runtime container and thread it everywhere instead of importing globals.
    - Construct in `lovelace-lcars-card.ts` and pass into `parseConfig`, `WidgetRegistry`, elements, color and animation layers.
    - Replace static `StoreProvider`/`stateManager`/`loggerService` globals with instances owned by the runtime.
    - Expose a thin context interface that elements/widgets can use without knowing about the card.

  Example sketch:
  ```ts
  export interface CardRuntime {
    store: ReactiveStore;
    state: StateManager;
    animations: AnimationManager;
    colors: ColorResolver;
    hass?: HomeAssistant;
    getShadowElement: (id: string) => Element | null;
    requestUpdate: () => void;
  }
  // In LcarsCard constructor: this.runtime = createCardRuntime(...);
  // Then pass runtime to parseConfig(...) and WidgetRegistry.expandWidget(...).
  ```

#### Reuse element graph on resize/state changes (don’t rebuild on every layout)
  - Problem: `_performLayoutCalculation` rebuilds groups/elements on each run (`_createLayoutGroups()` calls `parseConfig()` every time), then clears the previous graph. This loses object identity, forces re-wiring listeners, complicates animation state carry-over, and costs time.
  - Fix:
    - Build the element graph only when config changes; store it (e.g., `this._elementGraph`).
    - On container resize/HASS changes: reuse the same `LayoutElement` instances and call `LayoutEngine.calculateBoundingBoxes` with `dynamicHeight` and re-render. Use `updateIntrinsicSizesAndRecalculate` when text metrics change.
    - Ensure animation cleanup happens on the old graph before replacing it when the config actually changes.

#### Formalize a widget lifecycle API (remove cross-object hacks)
  - Problem: `logger-widget` stores a back-reference on the bounds element (`(elements[0] as RectangleElement)._loggerWidget = widget`) and reacts to resize via a special-case hook in `LcarsCard._handleResize`.
  - Fix:
    - Have `Widget` expose optional `onResize()`, `updateHass()`, `destroy()` and return both `elements` and `instance`.
    - Track widget instances in `LcarsCard` keyed by widget id; invoke `onResize()` uniformly.
    - Eliminate the `_loggerWidget` property in `layout/elements/rectangle.ts`.

#### Extract primitive element registration to an `ElementRegistry`
  - Problem: `ConfigParser._createLayoutElements` has a hardcoded map of element constructors.
  - Fix: Mirror the `WidgetRegistry` with an `ElementRegistry`. Benefits: cleaner extensibility, smaller parser, no central switch.

#### Unify types across schema, parser, and elements
  - Problem: Duplicated, divergent types: `types.ts` vs Zod-inferred types vs `LayoutElementProps` “any”-heavy usage.
  - Fix:
    - Make Zod the single source of truth; export `z.infer<typeof lcarsCardConfigSchema>` types and consume them end-to-end.
    - Split props: `BaseElementProps` + element-specific extensions (with discriminated unions on `type`), or use generics per element.
    - Remove duplicated text/appearance/layout definitions; prefer a single normalization step with well-typed output.

#### Rendering and diff performance
  - Problem: `_shouldUpdateLayout` compares SVG templates via `JSON.stringify` on `strings`/`values`. This is brittle and expensive.
  - Fix:
    - Track a stable `renderKey` per element or maintain a small checksum/hash of relevant computed values.
    - Prefer Lit’s keyed rendering and isolate changes (e.g., keyed `map` of elements) instead of full-array comparisons.
    - Update `viewBox` independently from element template changes to avoid unnecessary full rerenders.

### Additional improvements

#### Better animation/transform propagation cohesion
  - `utils/animation.ts` and `utils/transform-propagator.ts` are powerful; document and simplify the coupling:
    - Use `AnimationManager` as the only entry to propagation; let it own transform-propagation state via composition.
    - When reversing animations, centralize state and remove dual bookkeeping spread across managers.

#### Color system eventing vs polling
  - `colorResolver.scheduleDynamicColorChangeDetection` polls based on timeouts; prefer entity-scoped triggers:
    - Track entity dependencies per element once (`ColorResolver.extractEntityIds` already exists).
    - On HASS change, calculate the delta set of entities that actually changed, then notify interested elements only.

#### Strict lifecycle cleanup
  - Ensure all subscriptions and timeouts in `loggerService`, `transformPropagator`, `animationManager`, and `colorResolver` are torn down per-card on `disconnectedCallback` via the runtime container.
  - Avoid cleaning global state from one card instance that another card still needs.

#### Layout engine API ergonomics
  - Provide: `engine.setGroups(groups)` and `engine.recalculate(containerRect, { dynamicHeight })` so callers don’t need to clear/add every time.
  - Add `getDependencies()` on elements to build the graph without piggybacking on `canCalculateLayout()`.

#### DOM-free measurement pathways
  - `FontManager` and `TextMeasurement` already fallback to canvas; ensure all DOM-dependent calls are guarded and optional to aid SSR-like contexts and speed tests.

#### Error handling and logging discipline
  - Replace scattered `console.warn`/`console.error` with a scoped logger that can be silenced in production or routed in tests.

#### Directory organization
  - Consider:
    - `core/` (runtime, store, state)
    - `config/` (zod schema, normalization)
    - `layout/` (engine, elements, widgets, registry)
    - `render/` (Lit entry + styles)
    - `animation/` (manager, transform propagation)
    - `color/` (resolver, theme)
    - `hass/` (actions, data-fetcher, entity resolver)
    - `utils/` (geometry, offsets, shapes, fonts)

#### Action model
  - `ActionProcessor` is good; add typed guards and stricter compile-time checks to reduce runtime validation pathways.

#### Testing hooks (without expanding tests)
  - With per-card runtime, you can test each part in isolation (color, animation, store, layout) without global bleed.

### Expected impact
- Robust multi-card support; no global-state collisions.
- Faster updates on resizes and HASS changes; fewer GC pauses from object churn.
- Cleaner extension path for new primitives and widgets.
- Tighter type-safety; easier refactors.
- Simpler, safer lifecycle management; fewer leaks and dangling timeouts.
- Clearer responsibilities across modules.

- Summary of key edits you’d eventually make:
  - Introduce `CardRuntime` and remove global singletons (`stateManager`, `StoreProvider`, `loggerService`, etc.).
  - Cache the parsed element graph; reuse across recalculations.
  - Add `Widget` lifecycle methods and stop using `_loggerWidget` on `RectangleElement`.
  - Create `ElementRegistry` and move constructor map out of `ConfigParser`.
  - Replace template stringification diffs with keyed/stable render strategies.
  - Consolidate and derive types from Zod schemas across `types.ts` and element props.
